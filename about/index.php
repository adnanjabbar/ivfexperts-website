<!-- CLINICAL PHILOSOPHY -->

<div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-6">

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">
Clinical Philosophy
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Infertility management requires structured reasoning rather than procedural reflex. Every case is approached through systematic evaluation of male factors, female factors, endocrine balance, ovarian reserve, laboratory dynamics and systemic health indicators.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Embryology laboratory insight directly informs protocol design, fertilization strategy, embryo culture considerations and transfer planning — ensuring decisions are biologically grounded and clinically accountable.
