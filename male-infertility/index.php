Male Infertility Specialist in Lahore
</h1>

<p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Male factor infertility contributes to nearly 40–50% of infertility cases globally. In Pakistan, delayed evaluation and incomplete diagnostic workups frequently lead to prolonged uncertainty and inappropriate treatment escalation.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Structured male infertility management requires systematic evaluation of semen parameters, hormonal profile, testicular function and genetic considerations before proceeding toward assisted reproductive techniques.

Diagnostic Framework
</h2>

<ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
<li>• Semen analysis interpretation beyond basic count (motility, morphology, vitality)</li>
<li>• Repeat confirmation and lab standardization</li>
<li>• Hormonal evaluation (FSH, LH, Testosterone, Prolactin, TSH)</li>
<li>• Ultrasound and varicocele assessment</li>
<li>• DNA fragmentation testing in selected cases</li>
<li>• Genetic screening (karyotype, Y-chromosome microdeletions when indicated)</li>

Low Sperm Count (Oligospermia)
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Management of low sperm count requires differentiation between obstructive, endocrine, lifestyle-related and idiopathic causes. Treatment strategies may include hormonal optimization, antioxidant protocols, varicocele management or assisted reproductive support.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Decision between IUI, IVF or ICSI is determined by total motile sperm count, morphology quality and female partner parameters.

Azoospermia
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Azoospermia requires careful distinction between obstructive and non-obstructive forms. Hormonal profile interpretation, testicular examination and genetic evaluation are critical before intervention.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Advanced sperm retrieval techniques including PESA, TESA and Micro-TESE may be considered in selected cases, followed by ICSI where viable sperm are obtained.

DNA Fragmentation & Advanced Sperm Quality
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Standard semen analysis does not always reflect functional sperm integrity. Elevated DNA fragmentation may contribute to recurrent IVF failure, implantation failure or early pregnancy loss.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Interpretation requires correlation with age, oxidative stress factors and laboratory fertilization performance. Treatment planning may involve lifestyle correction, antioxidant protocols or ICSI strategy adjustment.

When IVF or ICSI Is Recommended
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
ICSI is typically considered in severe male factor infertility, azoospermia with retrieved sperm, or previous fertilization failure. IVF may be suitable in moderate cases depending on sperm motility and morphology.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Embryology laboratory insight informs fertilization approach, embryo culture conditions and transfer planning.
