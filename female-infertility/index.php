Female Infertility Specialist in Lahore
</h1>

<p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Female infertility requires structured assessment of ovulatory function, ovarian reserve, tubal integrity and uterine health before treatment escalation. In many cases, premature progression to IVF occurs without adequate diagnostic clarity.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Reproductive planning must integrate hormonal profile, ultrasound findings, age-related ovarian dynamics and systemic health factors before determining assisted reproductive strategy.

PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
PCOS is one of the most common causes of anovulatory infertility in Pakistan. Management requires differentiation between metabolic, endocrine and ovulatory phenotypes.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Treatment may include ovulation induction, metabolic correction, lifestyle optimization or assisted reproduction depending on clinical context.

Diminished Ovarian Reserve
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Low ovarian reserve requires careful protocol planning. AMH levels must be interpreted alongside age, AFC and stimulation response history.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
Advanced ovarian stimulation protocols, embryo banking or early IVF consideration may be indicated in selected patients.

Endometriosis
</h2>

<p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Endometriosis may impair fertility through inflammatory mechanisms, adhesions and altered ovarian reserve. Surgical versus ART decision-making depends on severity, age and symptom profile.
